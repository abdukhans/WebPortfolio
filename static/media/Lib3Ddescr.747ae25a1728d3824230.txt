This is a 3D renderer made entirely out of python. 
It has support for two drawing libraries namley, pygame and 
a more obscure library called graphics.py. None of these libraries
have 3D support, but I was able to nonetheless create a 3D renderer
from both of these libraries. This project can load 3D objects
from the internet and can do basic lighting as well as textures. What 
makes this project particularly unique is that it uses no onpengl.
All graphics calculations and drawing is done CPU side. As a result this 
project has minimals dependecies.
